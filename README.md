# TEi
TEi (Transposable element insertion identification) is design to identify TE insertion from paired-end illumina reads, takes whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and Histone Modification (H3K27ac et al.) data

# Installation
TEi has been successfully installed on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows, using the devtools package to install directly from GitHub

```r
devtools::install_github("tchen-tt/TEi")
```
# Contribution
Improvements and new features will be added on a regular basis, please post on the github page with any question or if you would like to contribute.
